# Tetris_python

 The aim of the coursework was to beat a random Tetris player that selected moves randomly and scored an average of 200 points. My player considered the total height of every column, the bumpiness of the blocks and the number of holes created for every single possible rotation and position. I assigned weights to rank the relative importance between the three parameters. Upon submission, my player scored a median score of about 29,000 surpassing the 17,000 grade boundary for an A grade. Certainly, my player could be improved by adding more parameters or perhaps a lookahead.
